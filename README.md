# Augmented-Backend

Spring boot API back end for Augmented Application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

To deploy to Heroku, install heroku on command line, set the git heroku upstream, and run 

```
git push heroku master
```

## Versioning

This project essentially uses [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning, with the PATCH number always assumed to be zero unless noted otherwise; i.e. 0.1, 0.2, 0.2.1, 0.3. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/cameronDz/augmented-backend/tags). Releases will only be published for MAJOR versions; i.e. 1.0, 2.0.

All development should be done on the "develop" branch, or on a feature branched off from develop. Before starting developing on a fix or feature, it should be in the GitHub [Issues section for the project](https://github.com/cameronDz/augmented-backend/issues). That issue should be marked as being worked on as well. Once the feature/issue is done, all commits will be squashed into master, and tagged with details of the feature/issue fix. The tags will be used for release notes so should be several sentences explaining the overall changes. The "develop" branch will be kept up until a Release, at which point it will be deleted and restarted. Releases should consist of between 10 - 20 tags. Most likely all tags will be deployed, which means mapping will change on every deployment. Hot fixes should still follow the protocol for being done in "develop" and squashed into "master".
